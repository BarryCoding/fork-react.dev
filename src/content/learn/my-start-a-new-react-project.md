title: My Start a New React Project

<Intro>

We recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community.

</Intro>


We’ve found that most apps and sites eventually build solutions to common problems such as code-splitting, routing, data fetching, and generating HTML.

By starting with a framework, you can get started with React quickly, and avoid essentially building your own framework later.

## Production-grade React frameworks {/*production-grade-react-frameworks*/}

These frameworks support all the features you need to deploy and scale your app in production and are working towards supporting our [full-stack architecture vision](#which-features-make-up-the-react-teams-full-stack-architecture-vision). All of the frameworks we recommend are open source with active communities for support, and can be deployed to your own server or a hosting provider.

### Next.js {/*nextjs-pages-router*/}

**[Next.js' Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/) is a full-stack React framework.** It's versatile and lets you create React apps of any size--from a mostly static blog to a complex dynamic application.  

To create a new Next.js project, run in your terminal:

<TerminalBlock>
npx create-next-app@latest
</TerminalBlock>

Next.js is maintained by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). You can [deploy a Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) to any Node.js or serverless hosting, or to your own server. Next.js also supports a [static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) which doesn't require a server.

#### Remix {/*remix*/}

**[Remix](https://remix.run/) is a full-stack React framework with nested routing.** It lets you break your app into nested parts that can load data in parallel and refresh in response to the user actions.  

To create a new Remix project, run:

<TerminalBlock>
npx create-remix
</TerminalBlock>

If you're new to Remix, check out the Remix [blog tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/tutorials/blog) (short) and [app tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/tutorials/jokes) (long).

Remix is maintained by [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). When you create a Remix project, you need to [pick your deployment target](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/deployment). You can deploy a Remix app to any Node.js or serverless hosting by using or writing an [adapter](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/other-api/adapter).

#### Expo (for native apps) {/*expo*/}

**[Expo](https://expo.dev/) is a React framework that lets you create universal Android, iOS, and web apps with truly native UIs.** It provides an SDK for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) that makes the native parts easier to use.  

To create a new Expo project, run:

<TerminalBlock>
npx create-expo-app
</TerminalBlock>

If you're new to Expo, check out the [Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/).

Expo is maintained by [Expo (the company)](https://expo.dev/about). Building apps with Expo is free, and you can submit them to the Google and Apple app stores without restrictions. Expo additionally provides opt-in paid cloud services.

## Bleeding-edge React frameworks {/*bleeding-edge-react-frameworks*/}

As we've explored how to continue improving React, we realized that integrating React more closely with frameworks (specifically, with routing, bundling, and server technologies) is our biggest opportunity to help React users build better apps. The Next.js team has agreed to collaborate with us in researching, developing, integrating, and testing framework-agnostic bleeding-edge React features like [React Server Components.](/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components)

### Next.js (App Router) {/*nextjs-app-router*/}

**[Next.js's App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs) is a redesign of the Next.js APIs aiming to fulfill the React team’s full-stack architecture vision.** It lets you fetch data in asynchronous components that run on the server or even during the build.

<DeepDive>

#### Which features make up the React team’s full-stack architecture vision? {/*which-features-make-up-the-react-teams-full-stack-architecture-vision*/}

Next.js's App Router bundler fully implements the official [React Server Components specification](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0188-server-components.md). This lets you mix build-time, server-only, and interactive components in a single React tree.

For example, you can write a server-only React component as an `async` function that reads from a database or from a file. Then you can pass data down from it to your interactive components:

```tsx
// This component runs *only* on the server (or during the build).
async function Talks({ confId }:{ confId: string }) {
  // 1. You're on the server, so you can talk to your data layer. API endpoint not required.
  const talks = await db.Talks.findAll({ confId });

  // 2. Add any amount of rendering logic. It won't make your JavaScript bundle larger.
  const videos = talks.map(talk => talk.video);

  // 3. Pass the data down to the components that will run in the browser.
  return <SearchableVideoList videos={videos} />;
}
```

Next.js's App Router also integrates [data fetching with Suspense](/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#suspense-in-data-frameworks). This lets you specify a loading state (like a skeleton placeholder) for different parts of your user interface directly in your React tree:

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<TalksLoading />}>
  <Talks confId={conf.id} />
</Suspense>
```
